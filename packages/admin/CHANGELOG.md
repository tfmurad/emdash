# @emdash-cms/admin

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#705](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/705) [`8ebdf1a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8ebdf1af65764cc4b72624e7758c4a666817aade) Thanks [@eba8](https://github.com/eba8)! - Adds admin white-labeling support via `admin` config in `astro.config.mjs`. Agencies can set a custom logo, site name, and favicon for the admin panel, separate from public site settings.

### Patch Changes

- [#680](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/680) [`2e4b205`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2e4b205b1df30bdb6bb96259f223b85610de5e78) Thanks [@CacheMeOwside](https://github.com/CacheMeOwside)! - Fixes dark mode toggle having no effect with the classic theme.

- [#732](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/732) [`e3e18aa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3e18aae92d31cf22efd11a0ba06110de24a076a) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Fixes select dropdown appearing behind dialog by removing explicit z-index values and adding `isolate` to the admin body for proper stacking context.

- [#647](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/647) [`743b080`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/743b0807f1a37fdedbcd37632058b557f493f3be) Thanks [@arashackdev](https://github.com/arashackdev)! - Adds Persian (Farsi) locale with full admin translations.
  Adds Vazirmatn as the default font family for Farsi.

- [#689](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/689) [`fa8d753`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fa8d7533e8ba7e02599372d580399dae88ecd891) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes the taxonomy term picker to match across diacritic boundaries.

  Typing `Mexico` in the admin picker now surfaces a term labeled `México` instead of prompting a duplicate create. Input and term labels are folded via NFD decomposition + lowercase before substring-matching, so editors who type without diacritics — or with locale keyboards that produce precomposed vs. combining forms — still see the canonical term.

  Before this fix, `"mexico"` and `"méxico"` were treated as distinct strings, so the picker showed zero suggestions and the editor had no way to find the existing term except to create a duplicate. Duplicate terms then split the taxonomy and broke public-facing filter pages that group content by slug.

  The exact-match check that gates the "Create new term" button uses the same fold, so typing `Mexico` when `México` exists also suppresses Create — closing the duplicate-creation loop.

### Minor Changes

- [#565](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/565) [`913cb62`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/913cb6239510f9959581cb74a70faa53a462a9aa) Thanks [@ophirbucai](https://github.com/ophirbucai)! - Adds full RTL (right-to-left) support to the admin UI by converting all directional Tailwind classes to their direction-aware equivalents.

### Patch Changes

- [#610](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/610) [`dfcb0cd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/dfcb0cd4ed65d10212d47622b51a22b0eacf8acb) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Passes plugin block definitions into the `PortableTextEditor` nested inside `WidgetEditor`, so custom plugin-registered block types (image blocks, marker blocks, etc.) can be inserted and rendered inside content-type widgets. The manifest is fetched with react-query in the top-level `Widgets` component, flattened into a `PluginBlockDef[]` list, and threaded through `WidgetAreaPanel` → `WidgetItem` → `WidgetEditor`.

- [#568](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/568) [`cf63b02`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cf63b0298576d062641cf88f37d6e7e86e4ddb3a) Thanks [@Vallhalen](https://github.com/Vallhalen)! - Fix document outline not showing headings on initial load. The outline now defers initial extraction to next tick (so TipTap finishes hydrating) and also listens for transaction events to catch programmatic content changes.

- [#564](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/564) [`0b32b2f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0b32b2f3906bf5bfed313044af6371480d43edc1) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Replaces the horizontal language-switch button bar on the admin login page with a dropdown, so the selector stays usable as more locales are added.

- [#592](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/592) [`6c92d58`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6c92d58767dc92548136a87cc90c1c6912da6695) Thanks [@asdfgl98](https://github.com/asdfgl98)! - Adds Korean locale support to the admin UI.

- [#604](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/604) [`39d285e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/39d285ea3d21b7b6277a554ae9cff011500655e1) Thanks [@all3f0r1](https://github.com/all3f0r1)! - Fixes loading spinner not centered under logo on the login page.

Enables proper text direction for RTL languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, and Urdu. Includes LocaleDirectionProvider component that syncs HTML dir/lang attributes with Kumo's DirectionProvider for automatic layout mirroring when locale changes.

Validates the value at integration load time and threads it through all passkey-related API routes.

  Updates the admin passkey setup and login flows to detect non-secure origins and explain that passkeys need HTTPS or `http://localhost` rather than implying the browser lacks WebAuthn support.
