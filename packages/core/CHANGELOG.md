# emdash

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#705](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/705) [`8ebdf1a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8ebdf1af65764cc4b72624e7758c4a666817aade) Thanks [@eba8](https://github.com/eba8)! - Adds admin white-labeling support via `admin` config in `astro.config.mjs`. Agencies can set a custom logo, site name, and favicon for the admin panel, separate from public site settings.

- [#742](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/742) [`c26442b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c26442be9887f1e3d3df37db5ccda6b260820a77) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `trustedProxyHeaders` config option so self-hosted deployments behind a reverse proxy can declare which client-IP headers to trust. Used by auth rate limits (magic-link, signup, passkey, OAuth device flow) and the public comment endpoint — without it, every request on a non-Cloudflare deployment was treated as "unknown" and rate limits were effectively disabled.

  Set the option in `astro.config.mjs`:

  ```js
  emdash({
  	trustedProxyHeaders: ["x-real-ip"], // nginx, Caddy, Traefik
  });
  ```

  or via the `EMDASH_TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADERS` env var (comma-separated). Headers are tried in order; values ending in `forwarded-for` are parsed as comma-separated lists.

  Also removes the user-agent-hash fallback on the comment endpoint. The fallback was meant to give anonymous commenters on non-Cloudflare deployments something approximating per-user rate limiting, but the UA is trivially rotatable; requests with no trusted IP now share a stricter "unknown" bucket. Operators behind a reverse proxy should set `trustedProxyHeaders` to restore per-IP bucketing.

  **Only set `trustedProxyHeaders` when you control the reverse proxy.** Trusting a forwarded-IP header from the open internet lets any client spoof their IP and defeats rate limiting.

### Patch Changes

- [#745](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/745) [`7186961`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7186961d3cbf706c1248e9e40b14b1a545ce8586) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes an unauthenticated denial-of-service via the 404 log. Every 404 response previously inserted a new row into `_emdash_404_log`, so an attacker could grow the database without bound by requesting unique nonexistent URLs. Repeat hits to the same path now dedup into a single row with a `hits` counter and `last_seen_at` timestamp, referrer and user-agent headers are truncated to bounded lengths, and the log is capped at 10,000 rows with oldest-first eviction.

- [#739](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/739) [`e9ecec2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e9ecec2d2dfb20ab4c413fb593a09a9f6d0fb27e) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Fixes the REST content API silently stripping `publishedAt` on create/update and `createdAt` on create. Importers can now preserve original publish and creation dates on migrated content. Gated behind `content:publish_any` (EDITOR+) so regular contributors cannot backdate posts. `createdAt` is intentionally not accepted on update — `created_at` is treated as immutable.

- [#732](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/732) [`e3e18aa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3e18aae92d31cf22efd11a0ba06110de24a076a) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Fixes select dropdown appearing behind dialog by removing explicit z-index values and adding `isolate` to the admin body for proper stacking context.

- [#695](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/695) [`fae63bd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fae63bdae8ff798a420379c36d3d05e54ea3628a) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `emdash seed` so entries declared with `"status": "published"` are actually published. Previously the seed wrote the content row with `status: "published"` and a `published_at` timestamp but never created a live revision, so the admin UI showed "Save & Publish" instead of "Unpublish" and `live_revision_id` stayed null. The seed now promotes published entries to a live revision on both create and update paths.

- [#744](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/744) [`30d8fe0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/30d8fe00025e058c71c8bfcd296946bb2042c4a7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a setup-window admin hijack by binding `/setup/admin` and `/setup/admin/verify` to a per-session nonce cookie. Previously an unauthenticated attacker who could reach a site during first-time setup could POST to `/setup/admin` between the legitimate admin's email submission and passkey verification, overwriting the stored email — the admin account would then be created with the attacker's address. The admin route now mints a cryptographically random nonce, stores it in setup state, and sets it as an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, `/_emdash/`-scoped cookie; the verify route rejects any request whose cookie does not match in constant time.

- [#685](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/685) [`d4a95bf`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d4a95bf313855e97108dfec4de3ab35f1a85f8ba) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes visual editing: clicking an editable field now opens the inline editor instead of always opening the admin in a new tab. The toolbar's manifest fetch was reading `manifest.collections` directly but the `/_emdash/api/manifest` endpoint wraps its payload in `{ data: … }`, so every field-kind lookup returned `null` and every click fell through to the admin-new-tab fallback.

- [#743](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/743) [`a31db7d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a31db7dcc6d9ddb09328eec815d255a4976ce3b8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Locks `emdash:site_url` after the first setup call so a spoofed Host header on a later step of the wizard can't overwrite it. Config (`siteUrl`) and env (`EMDASH_SITE_URL`) paths already took precedence; this is a defence-in-depth guard for deployments that rely on the request-origin fallback.

- [#737](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/737) [`adb118c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/adb118c99d867be7b17714798e1e565ccdf096e4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Rate-limits the self-signup request endpoint to prevent abuse. `POST /_emdash/api/auth/signup/request` now allows 3 requests per 5 minutes per IP, matching the existing limit on magic-link/send. Over-limit requests return the same generic success response as allowed-but-ignored requests, so the limit isn't observable to callers.

- [#738](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/738) [`080a4f1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/080a4f1efdd793cddd49767d8b18cd53162f39e3) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Strengthens SSRF protection on the import pipeline against DNS-rebinding. The `validateExternalUrl` helper now also blocks known wildcard DNS services (`nip.io`, `sslip.io`, `xip.io`, `traefik.me`, `lvh.me`, `localtest.me`) and trailing-dot FQDN forms of blocked hostnames. A new `resolveAndValidateExternalUrl` resolves the target hostname via DNS-over-HTTPS (Cloudflare) and rejects if any returned IP is in a private range. `ssrfSafeFetch` and the plugin unrestricted-fetch path now use the DNS-aware validator on every hop. This adds two DoH round-trips per outbound request; self-hosted admins whose egress blocks `cloudflare-dns.com` can inject a custom resolver via `setDefaultDnsResolver`.

- [#736](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/736) [`81fe93b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/81fe93bc675581ddd0161eaabbe7a3471ec76529) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Restricts Subscriber-role access to draft, scheduled, and trashed content. Subscribers retain `content:read` for member-only published content but no longer see non-published items via the REST API or MCP server. Adds a new `content:read_drafts` permission (Contributor and above) that gates `/compare`, `/revisions`, `/trash`, `/preview-url`, and the corresponding MCP tools.

- Updated dependencies [[`8ebdf1a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8ebdf1af65764cc4b72624e7758c4a666817aade), [`2e4b205`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2e4b205b1df30bdb6bb96259f223b85610de5e78), [`e3e18aa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3e18aae92d31cf22efd11a0ba06110de24a076a), [`743b080`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/743b0807f1a37fdedbcd37632058b557f493f3be), [`fa8d753`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fa8d7533e8ba7e02599372d580399dae88ecd891), [`81fe93b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/81fe93bc675581ddd0161eaabbe7a3471ec76529)]:

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#626](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/626) [`1859347`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/18593475bb8e30ce1aab55d72903d02dbf3fd0cb) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds eager hydration of taxonomy terms on `getEmDashCollection` and `getEmDashEntry` results. Each entry now exposes a `data.terms` field keyed by taxonomy name (e.g. `post.data.terms.tag`, `post.data.terms.category`), populated via a single batched JOIN query alongside byline hydration. Templates that previously looped and called `getEntryTerms(collection, id, taxonomy)` per entry can read `entry.data.terms` directly and skip the N+1 round-trip.

  New exports: `getAllTermsForEntries`, `invalidateTermCache`.

  Reserved field slugs now also block `terms`, `bylines`, and `byline` at schema-creation time to prevent new fields shadowing the hydrated values. Existing installs that already have a user-defined field with any of those slugs will see the hydrated value overwrite the stored value on read (consistent with the pre-existing behavior of `bylines` / `byline` hydration); rename the field to keep its data accessible.

- [#600](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/600) [`9295cc1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9295cc199f72c9b9adff236e4a72ba412604493f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds Noto Sans as the default admin UI font via the Astro Font API. Fonts are downloaded from Google at build time and self-hosted. The base font covers Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Devanagari, and Vietnamese. Additional scripts (Arabic, CJK, Hebrew, Thai, etc.) can be added via the new `fonts.scripts` config option. Set `fonts: false` to disable and use system fonts.

### Patch Changes

- [#648](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/648) [`ada4ac7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ada4ac7105f72a96eaf4ce3d884d705d8aba0119) Thanks [@CacheMeOwside](https://github.com/CacheMeOwside)! - Adds the missing `url` field type for seed files, content type builder, and content editor with client-side URL validation.

- [#658](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/658) [`f279320`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f279320ef49c68662c8936db15e21f46cb57e82b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `after(fn)` — a helper for deferring bookkeeping work past the HTTP response. On Cloudflare it hands off to `waitUntil` (extending the worker's lifetime); on Node it fire-and-forgets (the event loop keeps the process alive for the next request anyway). Host binding is plumbed through a new `virtual:emdash/wait-until` virtual module so core stays runtime-neutral — Cloudflare-specific imports live in the integration layer, not in request-handling code.

  First use: cron stale-lock recovery (`_emdash_cron_tasks` UPDATE) now runs after the response ships instead of blocking it. On D1 this shaves a primary-routed write off the cold-start critical path.

  Usage:

  ```ts
  import { after } from "emdash";

  // Fire-and-forget; errors are caught and logged so a deferred task
  // never surfaces as an unhandled rejection.
  after(async () => {
  	await recordAuditEntry();
  });
  ```

- [#642](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/642) [`7f75193`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7f75193df49967c871acdf47a22f0e48d2e98986) Thanks [@Pouf5](https://github.com/Pouf5)! - Adds `maxUploadSize` config option to set the maximum media file upload size in bytes. Defaults to 52_428_800 (50 MB) — existing behaviour is unchanged.

- [#595](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/595) [`cfd01f3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cfd01f3bd484b38549a5a164ad006279a2024788) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes playground initialization crash caused by syncSearchState attempting first-time FTS enablement during field creation.

- [#663](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/663) [`38d637b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/38d637b520f8596758939ec08a7b534bb9550967) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Cache `getSiteSetting(key)` per-request. It was firing an uncached `options` table read on every call, so templates that pull several settings (or `EmDashHead` reading `seo` on every page render) paid N round-trips to the D1 primary instead of sharing one. Noticeable on colos far from the primary — APS/APE were seeing ~30–100 ms of avoidable warm-render latency per page.

  Wraps each key in `requestCached("siteSetting:${key}", ...)` so concurrent callers in a single render share the in-flight query.

- [#631](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/631) [`31d2f4e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/31d2f4edd5e84391e23f2eb6ff833e2fd4e51077) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Improves cold-start performance for anonymous page requests. Sites with D1 replicas far from the worker colo should see the biggest improvement; on the blog-demo the homepage cold request on Asia colos dropped from several seconds to under a second.

  Three underlying changes:
  - Search index health checks run on demand (on the first search request) rather than at worker boot, reclaiming the time a boot-time scan spent walking every searchable collection.
  - Module-scoped caches (manifest, taxonomy names, byline existence, taxonomy-assignment existence) are now reused across anonymous requests that route through D1 read replicas. They previously rebuilt on every request.
  - Cold-start Server-Timing headers break runtime init into sub-phases (`rt.db`, `rt.plugins`, etc.) so further regressions are easier to diagnose.

- [#605](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/605) [`445b3bf`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/445b3bfecf1f4cdc109be865685eb6ae6e0c06e6) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes D1 read replicas being bypassed for anonymous public page traffic. The middleware fast path now asks the database adapter for a per-request scoped Kysely, so anonymous reads land on the nearest replica instead of the primary-pinned singleton binding.

  All D1-specific semantics (Sessions API, constraint selection, bookmark cookie) live in `@emdash-cms/cloudflare/db/d1` behind a single `createRequestScopedDb(opts)` function. Core middleware has no D1-specific logic. Adapters opt in via a new `supportsRequestScope: boolean` flag on `DatabaseDescriptor`; `d1()` sets it to true.

  Other fixes in the same change:
  - Nested `runWithContext` calls in the request-context middleware now merge the parent context instead of replacing it, so an outer per-request db override is preserved through edit/preview flows.
  - Baseline security headers now forward Astro's cookie symbol across the response clone so `cookies.set()` calls in middleware survive.
  - Any write (authenticated or anonymous) now forces `first-primary`, so an anonymous form/comment POST isn't racing across replicas.
  - The session user is read once per request and reused in both the fast path and the full runtime init (previously read twice on authenticated public-page traffic).
  - Bookmark cookies are validated only for length (≤1024) and absence of control characters — no stricter shape check, so a future D1 bookmark format change won't silently degrade consistency.
  - The `!config` bail-out now still applies baseline security headers.
  - `__ec_d1_bookmark` references aligned to `__em_d1_bookmark` across runtime, docs, and JSDoc.

- [#654](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/654) [`943d540`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/943d54060eb6675dda643b09f7cdb80bbbe5d566) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Dedups repeat DB queries within a single page render. Measured against the query-count fixture:
  - The "has any bylines / has any taxonomy terms" probes were module-scoped singletons, but the bundler duplicates those modules across chunks — each chunk ended up with its own copy of the singleton, so the probe re-ran whenever a different chunk called the helper. Stored on `globalThis` with a Symbol key (same pattern as `request-context.ts`), so a single value is shared across all chunks now.
  - Wraps `getCollectionInfo`, `getTaxonomyDef`, `getTaxonomyTerms`, and `getEmDashCollection` in the request-scoped cache so two callers with the same arguments in the same render share a single query.

  Biggest wins land on pages that render multiple content-heavy components (a post detail page with comments, byline credits, and sidebar widgets). On the fixture post page: -3 queries cold / -1 warm under SQLite, -2 queries cold under D1.

- [#668](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/668) [`2cb3165`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2cb31658037bc2b9ebfd3c5b82e4fb709b4a1fad) Thanks [@CacheMeOwside](https://github.com/CacheMeOwside)! - Fixes boolean field checkbox displaying as unchecked after publish in the admin UI.

- [#500](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/500) [`14c923b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/14c923b5eaf23f6e601cd2559ce9fc3af2f40822) Thanks [@all3f0r1](https://github.com/all3f0r1)! - Adds inline term creation in the post editor taxonomy sidebar. Tags show a "Create" option when no match exists; categories get an "Add new" button below the list.

- [#606](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/606) [`c5ef0f5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c5ef0f5befda129e4040822ee341f8cd8bb5acaf) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Caches the manifest in memory and in the database to eliminate N+1 schema queries per request. Batches site info queries during initialization. Cold starts read 1 cached row instead of rebuilding from scratch.

- [#671](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/671) [`f839381`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f8393819e74b31c269ba6c5088eab1f40b438c62) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Fixes MCP OAuth discovery and dynamic client registration so EmDash only advertises supported client registration mechanisms and rejects unsupported redirect URIs or token endpoint auth methods during client registration. Also exempts OAuth protocol endpoints (token, register, device code, device token) from the Origin-based CSRF check, since these endpoints are called cross-origin by design (MCP clients, CLIs, native apps) and carry no ambient credentials, and sends the required CORS headers so browser-based MCP clients can reach them.

- [#664](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/664) [`002d0ac`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/002d0accd87fc0b6983a3a45fd11227398837366) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - `getSiteSetting(key)` now transparently piggybacks on `getSiteSettings()` when the batch has already been loaded in the current request. If a parent template has called `getSiteSettings()` (which is request-cached), a later `getSiteSetting("seo")` — from `EmDashHead`, a plugin, or user code — reads the key from that cached result instead of firing its own round-trip. Falls back to a per-key cached query when nothing has been primed.

  Exposes `peekRequestCache(key)` for internal use by other helpers that want the same "read from a broader cached query if available" pattern.

  On the blog-demo fixture: the SEO call added in PR #613 now costs zero extra queries per page (it reads from the Base layout's existing `getSiteSettings()` result).

- [#465](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/465) [`0a61ef4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0a61ef412ef8d2643fa847caeddbe8b8933d3fc7) Thanks [@Pouf5](https://github.com/Pouf5)! - Fixes FTS5 tables not being created when a searchable collection is created or updated via the Admin UI.

- [#636](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/636) [`6d41fe1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6d41fe16539d09c53916b4ca41c515a29f8e0d4f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes two correctness issues from the #631 cold-start work:
  - `ensureSearchHealthy()` now runs against the runtime's singleton database instead of the per-request session-bound one. The verify step reads, but a corrupted index triggers a rebuild write, and D1 Sessions on a GET request uses `first-unconstrained` routing that's free to land on a replica. The singleton goes through the default binding, which the adapter correctly promotes to `first-primary` for writes.
  - The playground request-context middleware now sets `dbIsIsolated: true`. Without it, schema-derived caches (manifest, taxonomy defs, byline/term existence probes) could carry values across playground sessions that have independent schemas.

- [#627](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/627) [`b158e40`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b158e40de596e8ca3cb056495276ec97403c24d9) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Prime the request-scoped cache for `getEntryTerms` during collection and entry hydration. `getEmDashCollection` and `getEmDashEntry` already fetch taxonomy terms for their results via a single batched JOIN; now the same data is seeded into the per-request cache under the same keys `getEntryTerms` uses, so existing templates that still call `getEntryTerms(collection, id, taxonomy)` in a loop get cache hits instead of a serial DB round-trip per iteration.

  Empty-result entries are seeded with `[]` for every taxonomy that applies to the collection so "this post has no tags" also short-circuits without a query. Cache entries are scoped to the request context via ALS and GC'd with it.

- [#653](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/653) [`f97d6ab`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f97d6ab0f1995fe86862aeb20de65d0ee774699f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds opt-in query instrumentation for performance regression testing. Setting `EMDASH_QUERY_LOG=1` causes the Kysely log hook to emit `[emdash-query-log]`-prefixed NDJSON on stdout for every DB query executed inside a request, tagged with the route, method, and an `X-Perf-Phase` header value. Zero runtime overhead when the flag is unset — the log option is only attached to Kysely when enabled.

  Also exposes the helpers at `emdash/database/instrumentation` so first-party adapters (e.g. `@emdash-cms/cloudflare`) can wire the same hook into their per-request Kysely instances.

- [#613](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/613) [`e67b940`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e67b94056c21c716eada0fff7350b8592c6a3c68) Thanks [@nickgraynews](https://github.com/nickgraynews)! - Fixes site SEO settings `googleVerification` and `bingVerification` not being emitted into `<head>`. The fields were stored in the database and editable in the admin UI but were never rendered as `<meta name="google-site-verification">` or `<meta name="msvalidate.01">` tags, making meta-tag verification with Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools impossible. EmDashHead now loads site SEO settings and renders these tags on every page.

- [#659](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/659) [`0896ec8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0896ec81065da7fa9b93053d366500805602c8fe) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Two query-count reductions on the request hot path:
  - **Widget areas now fetch in a single query.** `getWidgetArea(name)` used to do two round-trips — one for the area, one for its widgets. Single left-join now. Saves one query per `<WidgetArea>` rendered on a page.
  - **Dropped the "has any bylines / has any term assignments" probes.** Those fired on every hydration call to save a single query on sites with zero bylines/terms — exactly the wrong tradeoff. The batch hydration queries already handle empty sites at the same cost, so the probes are removed. Pre-migration databases (tables not created yet) are still handled via an `isMissingTableError` catch. Saves two queries per render on pages that hydrate bylines and taxonomy terms.

  On the fixture post-detail page: SQLite `/posts/[slug]` drops from 34 → 32, D1 from 43 → 39. The widget-area JOIN shaves one off every page that renders a widget area.

  `invalidateBylineCache()` and `invalidateTermCache()` are preserved as no-op exports so callers don't break.

### Minor Changes

- [#540](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/540) [`82c6345`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/82c63451ff05ddc0a8e2777c124907358814da2b) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Adds `where: { status?, locale? }` to `ContentListOptions`, letting plugins narrow `ContentAccess.list()` results at the database layer instead of filtering the returned array. The underlying repository already supports these filters — this PR only exposes them through the plugin-facing type.

- [#551](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/551) [`598026c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/598026c99083325c281b9e7ab87e9724e11f2c8d) Thanks [@ophirbucai](https://github.com/ophirbucai)! - Adds RTL (right-to-left) language support infrastructure. Enables proper text direction for RTL languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, and Urdu. Includes LocaleDirectionProvider component that syncs HTML dir/lang attributes with Kumo's DirectionProvider for automatic layout mirroring when locale changes.

### Patch Changes

Links are sanitized via `sanitizeHref()`. Table styles now use CSS custom properties with fallbacks.

### Minor Changes

- [#539](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/539) [`8ed7969`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8ed7969df2c95790d7c635ef043df20bb21b6156) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Adds `locale` to the `ContentItem` type returned by the plugin content access API. Follow-up to #536 — plugins that build i18n URLs from content records need the locale to pick the right URL prefix, otherwise multilingual content is emitted at default-locale URLs.

- [#523](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/523) [`5d9120e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5d9120eca846dd7c446d05f1b9c14fe1b7e394ec) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Add `nlweb` to the allowed `rel` values for `page:metadata` link contributions, letting plugins inject `<link rel="nlweb" href="...">` tags for agent/conversational endpoint discovery.

- [#536](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/536) [`9318c56`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9318c5684fb293f167cd3e6f9e9a3ca12f042d7b) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Adds `slug`, `status`, and `publishedAt` to the `ContentItem` type returned by the plugin content access API. Exports `ContentPublishStateChangeEvent` type. Fires `afterDelete` hooks on permanent content deletion.

- [#519](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/519) [`5c0776d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5c0776deee7005ba580fc7dc8f778e805ab82cef) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Enables the MCP server endpoint by default. The endpoint at `/_emdash/api/mcp` requires bearer token auth, so it has no effect unless a client is configured. Set `mcp: false` to disable.

  Fixes MCP server crash ("exports is not defined") on Cloudflare in dev mode by pre-bundling the MCP SDK's CJS dependencies for workerd.

### Patch Changes

- [#515](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/515) [`5beddc3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5beddc31785aa7de086b2b22a2a9612f9d1c8aaf) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Reduces logged-out page load queries by caching byline existence, URL patterns, and redirect rules at worker level with proper invalidation.

- [#512](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/512) [`f866c9c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f866c9cc0dd1ac62035ef3e06bbe8d8d7d1c44a0) Thanks [@mahesh-projects](https://github.com/mahesh-projects)! - Fixes save/publish race condition in visual editor toolbar. When a user blurred a field and immediately clicked Publish, the in-flight save PUT could arrive at the server after the publish POST, causing the stale revision to be promoted silently. Introduces `pendingSavePromise` so `publish()` chains onto the pending save rather than firing immediately.

- [#537](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/537) [`1acf174`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1acf1743e7116a5f00b11536306ebb55edbf3b2e) Thanks [@Glacier-Luo](https://github.com/Glacier-Luo)! - Fixes plugin bundle resolving dist path before source, which caused build failures and potential workspace-wide source file destruction.

- [#538](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/538) [`678cc8c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/678cc8c4c34a23e8a7aeda652b0ec87070983b07) Thanks [@Glacier-Luo](https://github.com/Glacier-Luo)! - Fixes revision pruning crash on PostgreSQL by replacing column alias in HAVING clause with the aggregate expression.

- [#497](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/497) [`6492ea2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6492ea202c5872132c952678862eb6f564c78b7c) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes migration 011 rollback, plugin media upload returning wrong ID, MCP taxonomy tools bypassing validation, and FTS query escaping logic.

- [#517](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/517) [`b382357`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b38235702fd075d95c04b2a6874804ca45baa721) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Improves plugin safety: hooks log dependency cycles, timeouts clear timers, routes don't leak error internals, one-shot cron tasks retry with exponential backoff (max 5), marketplace downloads validate redirect targets.

- [#532](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/532) [`1b743ac`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1b743acc35750dc36de4acdd95164c34cd7d092f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes cold-start query explosion (159 -> ~25 queries) by short-circuiting migrations when all are applied, fixing FTS triggers to exclude soft-deleted content, and preventing false-positive FTS index rebuilds on every startup.

- Updated dependencies [[`3a96aa7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3a96aa7f5671f6c718ab066e02c61fb55b33d901), [`c869df2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c869df2b08decae6dc9c85bdfca83cc6577203cf), [`10ebfe1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/10ebfe19b81feacfe99cfaf2daf4976eaac17bd4), [`275a21c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/275a21c389c121cbac6daa6be497ae3b6c1bfc6d), [`af0647c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/af0647c7352922ad63077613771150d8178263ed), [`b89e7f3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b89e7f3811488ebe8fbe28068baa18f7f25844ad), [`20b03b4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/20b03b480156a5c901298a1ab9c968c800179215), [`ba0a5af`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ba0a5afccf110465b72916e23db4ff975d81bc2e), [`e2f96aa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e2f96aa74bd936832a3a4d0636e81f948adb51c7), [`4645103`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4645103f06ae9481b07dba14af07ac0ff57e32cf)]:

- [#457](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/457) [`f2b3973`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f2b39739c13cbef86ed16be007f08abf86b0f9ca) Thanks [@UpperM](https://github.com/UpperM)! - Adds runtime resolution of S3 storage config from `S3_*` environment
  variables (`S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
  `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`). Any field omitted from
  `s3({...})` is read from the matching env var on Node at runtime, so
  container images can be built once and receive credentials at boot without a
  rebuild. Explicit values in `s3({...})` still take precedence.

  `s3()` with no arguments is now valid for fully env-driven deployments.
  `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` are now optional in `S3StorageConfig`
  (both or neither). Workers users should continue passing explicit values to
  `s3({...})`.

### Patch Changes

The version and git commit SHA are now injected at build time via tsdown/Vite `define`, reading from package.json and `git rev-parse`.

- [#494](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/494) [`a283954`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a28395455cec14cea6d382a604e2598ead097d99) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds defensive identifier validation to all SQL interpolation points to prevent injection via dynamic identifiers.

### Minor Changes

- [#367](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/367) [`8f44ec2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8f44ec23a4b23f636f9689c075d29edfa4962c7c) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Adds `content:afterPublish` and `content:afterUnpublish` plugin hooks, fired after content is published or unpublished. Both are fire-and-forget notifications requiring `read:content` capability, supporting trusted and sandboxed plugins.

- [#431](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/431) [`7ee7d95`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7ee7d95ee32df2b1915144030569382fe97aef3d) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Per-collection sitemaps with sitemap index and lastmod

  `/sitemap.xml` now serves a `<sitemapindex>` with one child sitemap per SEO-enabled collection. Each collection's sitemap is at `/sitemap-{collection}.xml` with `<lastmod>` on both index entries and individual URLs. Uses the collection's `url_pattern` for correct URL building.

- [#414](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/414) [`4d4ac53`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4d4ac536eeb664b7d0ca9f1895a51960a47ecafe) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Adds `breadcrumbs?: BreadcrumbItem[]` to `PublicPageContext` so themes can publish a breadcrumb trail as part of the page context, and SEO plugins (or any other `page:metadata` consumer) can read it without having to invent their own per-theme override mechanism. `BreadcrumbItem` is also exported from the `emdash` package root. The field is optional and non-breaking — existing themes and plugins work unchanged, and consumers can adopt it incrementally. Empty array (`breadcrumbs: []`) is an explicit opt-out signal (e.g. for homepages); `undefined` means "no opinion, fall back to consumer's own derivation".

- [#111](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/111) [`87b0439`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/87b0439927454a275833992de4244678b47b9aa3) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Adds repeater field type for structured repeating data

- [#382](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/382) [`befaeec`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/befaeecfefd968d14693e96e3cdaa691ffabe7d3) Thanks [@UpperM](https://github.com/UpperM)! - Adds `siteUrl` config option to fix reverse-proxy origin mismatch. Replaces `passkeyPublicOrigin` with a single setting that covers all origin-dependent features: passkeys, CSRF, OAuth, auth redirects, MCP discovery, snapshots, sitemap, robots.txt, and JSON-LD.

  Supports `EMDASH_SITE_URL` / `SITE_URL` environment variables for container deployments where the domain is only known at runtime.

  Disables Astro's `security.checkOrigin` (EmDash's own CSRF layer handles origin validation with dual-origin support and runtime siteUrl resolution). When `siteUrl` is set in config, also sets `security.allowedDomains` so `Astro.url` reflects the public origin in templates.

  **Breaking:** `passkeyPublicOrigin` is removed. Rename to `siteUrl` in your `astro.config.mjs`.

Adds error state to the admin UI so fetch failures are visible instead of silently swallowed.

- [#324](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/324) [`c75cc5b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c75cc5b82cb678c5678859b249d545e12be6fd97) Thanks [@barckcode](https://github.com/barckcode)! - Fixes admin editor crash when image blocks lack the `asset` wrapper. Image blocks with `url` at the top level (e.g. from CMS migrations) now render correctly instead of throwing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'url')`.

- [#353](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/353) [`6ebb797`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6ebb7975be00a4d756cdb56955c88395840e3fec) Thanks [@ilicfilip](https://github.com/ilicfilip)! - fix(core): pass field.options through to admin manifest for plugin field widgets

Previously, `setPluginStatus` rebuilt the hook pipeline but never invoked the lifecycle hooks. Now `plugin:activate` fires after the pipeline is rebuilt with the plugin included, and `plugin:deactivate` fires on the current pipeline before the plugin is removed.

- [#357](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/357) [`6474dae`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6474daee29b6d0be289c995755658755d93316b1) Thanks [@Vallhalen](https://github.com/Vallhalen)! - Fix: default adminPages and dashboardWidgets to empty arrays in manifest to prevent admin UI crash when plugins omit these properties.

- [#453](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/453) [`30c9a96`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/30c9a96404e913ea8b3039ef4a5bc70541647eec) Thanks [@all3f0r1](https://github.com/all3f0r1)! - Fixes `ctx.content.create()` and `ctx.content.update()` so plugins can write
  to the core SEO panel. When the input `data` contains a reserved `seo` key,
  it is now extracted and routed to `_emdash_seo` via the SEO repository,
  matching the REST API shape. `ctx.content.get()` and `ctx.content.list()`
  also hydrate the `seo` field on returned items for SEO-enabled collections.

- [#326](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/326) [`122c236`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/122c2364fc4cfc9082f036f9affcee13d9b00511) Thanks [@barckcode](https://github.com/barckcode)! - Fixes WXR import not preserving original post dates or publish status. Uses `wp:post_date_gmt` (UTC) with fallback chain to `pubDate` (RFC 2822) then `wp:post_date` (site-local). Handles the WordPress `0000-00-00 00:00:00` sentinel for unpublished drafts. Sets `published_at` for published posts. Applies to both WXR file upload and plugin-based import paths.

- [#434](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/434) [`9cb5a28`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9cb5a28001cc8e6d650ec6b45c9ea091a4e9e3c2) Thanks [@hayatosc](https://github.com/hayatosc)! - Avoid accessing sessions on prerendered public routes.

- [#119](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/119) [`e1014ef`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e1014eff18301ff68ac75d19157d3500ebe890c5) Thanks [@blmyr](https://github.com/blmyr)! - Fix plugin `page:metadata` and `page:fragments` hooks not firing for anonymous public page visitors. The middleware's early-return fast-path for unauthenticated requests now initializes the runtime (skipping only the manifest query), so plugin contributions render via `<EmDashHead>`, `<EmDashBodyStart>`, and `<EmDashBodyEnd>` for all visitors. Also adds `collectPageMetadata` and `collectPageFragments` to the `EmDashHandlers` interface.

- [#424](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/424) [`476cb3a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/476cb3a585d30acb2d4d172f94c5d2b4e5b6377b) Thanks [@csfalcao](https://github.com/csfalcao)! - Fixes public access to the search API (#104). The auth middleware blocked `/_emdash/api/search` before the handler ran, so #107's handler-level change never took effect for anonymous callers. Adds the endpoint to `PUBLIC_API_EXACT` so the shipped `LiveSearch` component works on public sites without credentials. Admin endpoints (`/search/enable`, `/search/rebuild`, `/search/stats`, `/search/suggest`) remain authenticated.

- [#181](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/181) [`9d10d27`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9d10d2791fe16be901d9d138e434bd79cf9335c4) Thanks [@ilicfilip](https://github.com/ilicfilip)! - fix(admin): use collection urlPattern for preview button fallback URL

Adds build-time and bundle-time validation to catch misconfigured plugin exports early.

- [#298](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/298) [`f112ac4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f112ac48194d1c2302e93756d54b116d3d207c22) Thanks [@BenjaminPrice](https://github.com/BenjaminPrice)! - Fixes install telemetry using an unstable hash that inflated install counts. Uses the site's request origin as a stable hash seed for accurate per-site deduplication. Denormalizes install_count on the marketplace plugins table for query performance.

- [#214](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/214) [`e9a6f7a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e9a6f7ac3ceeaf5c2d0a557e4cf6cab5f3d7d764) Thanks [@SARAMALI15792](https://github.com/SARAMALI15792)! - Optimizes D1 database indexes to eliminate full table scans in admin panel. Adds
  composite indexes on ec\_\* content tables for common query patterns (deleted_at +
  updated_at/created_at + id) and rewrites comment counting to use partial indexes.
  Reduces D1 row reads by 90%+ for dashboard operations.

- [#107](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/107) [`b297fdd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b297fdd88dadcabeb93f47abea9f24f70b7d4b71) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Allows public access to search API for frontend LiveSearch

Validates the value at integration load time and threads it through all passkey-related API routes.

  Updates the admin passkey setup and login flows to detect non-secure origins and explain that passkeys need HTTPS or `http://localhost` rather than implying the browser lacks WebAuthn support.

- [#105](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/105) [`8e28cfc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8e28cfc5d66f58f0fb91aa35c02afdd426bb6555) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix CLI `--json` flag so JSON output is clean. Previously, `consola.success()` and other log messages leaked into stdout alongside the JSON data, making it unparseable by scripts. Log messages now go to stderr when `--json` is set.

Fixes crashes when importing sites using plugins (Elementor, WooCommerce, ACF, etc.) that register post types with hyphens, uppercase letters, or other characters invalid in EmDash collection slugs. Reserved collection slugs are prefixed with `wp_` to avoid conflicts.
