Adds `settings_get` and `settings_update` MCP tools so agents can read and update site-wide settings (title, tagline, logo, favicon, URL, posts-per-page, date format, timezone, social, SEO). `settings_get` resolves media references (logo/favicon/seo.defaultOgImage) to URLs; `settings_update` is a partial update that preserves omitted fields. New `settings:read` (EDITOR+) and `settings:manage` (ADMIN) API token scopes back the tools, with matching options in the personal API token settings UI.
