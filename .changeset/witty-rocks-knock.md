Adds `taxonomies:manage` and `menus:manage` API token scopes for fine-grained control over taxonomy and menu mutations via MCP and REST. Existing tokens with `content:write` continue to work for those operations: `content:write` now implicitly grants `menus:manage` and `taxonomies:manage` so PATs issued before the split keep their effective permissions. The reverse implication does not hold — a token with only `menus:manage` cannot create or edit content.
