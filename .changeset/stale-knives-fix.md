Adds pluggable auth provider system with AT Protocol as the first plugin-based provider. Refactors GitHub and Google OAuth from hardcoded buttons into the same `AuthProviderDescriptor` interface. All auth methods (passkey, AT Protocol, GitHub, Google) are equal options on the login page and setup wizard.
